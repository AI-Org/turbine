Use Wind Turbine Data for failure detection in Wind Turbine : http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy12osti/51653.pdf. The paper <SCADA data for failure detection in Wind Turbines> presents mostly the entire use case that we are targeting

Description:
Data is categorized under the technical name: CART 2 (2-bladed Controls Advanced Research Turbine) Variable Speed Data
Data is saved in a .dat format with supporting files in .c, .h, and .hdr formats. 
The supporting files can be read with any text editor.
The .dat files are most easily read using the accompanying Matlab (.m) files.

Purpose:

Citation TEXT
Data is from NRELâ€™s 2-bladed Controls Advanced Research Turbine (CART2) operating in variable speed mode on April 27, 2002. 
4.5 hours of data collected at 100 Hz from 90 sensor channels are available from 18:24-22:54 UTC.

For field-testing control paradigms

Suitable for our Data Science Use Case
An analysis pipeline (satisfies our Data Science predictive/preventive use case)


2. A sensor placement (see picture below) : Satisfies GE use case targeting IOT.
3. Fault Bits
eg: for a Window of 10 minutes at 100 hz 60000 data points are collected
